Cross-platform (Windows and MacOS) step-by-step sudoku solver, using .NET MAUI.
First time using .NET MAUI, and first time using C# in a non-trivial project.

Currently very limited solving ability. I will add the more advanced solving techniques later, so far I have just been focused on the GUI.
I might look into supporting Android and IOS later.
